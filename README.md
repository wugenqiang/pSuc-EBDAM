> pSuc-EDBAM: Predicting lysine succinylation sites in proteins based on ensemble dense blocks and an attention module.

üêπ A new method for identifying lysine succinylation sites.

For the convenience of the most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for pSuc-EDBAM has been established at http://bioinfo.wugenqiang.top/pSuc-EDBAM/, by which users can easily obtain the results they want without going through the detailed mathematics.
