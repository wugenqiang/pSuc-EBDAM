> pSuc-EDBAM: Predicting Lysine Succinylation Sites in Proteins Based on Ensemble Dense Blocks and Attention Module.

üêπ A new method for identifying lysine succinylation.

For the convenience of the most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for pSuc-EDBAM has been established at http://bioinfo.wugenqiang.top/pSuc-EDBAM/ as a major site and http://117.50.181.194/pSuc-EDBAM/ as a backup, by which users can easily obtain the results they want without going through the detailed mathematics.
